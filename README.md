# LLM Document Validator with Human-in-the-Loop

## Description
The **LLM Document Validator with Human-in-the-Loop** is an AI-driven solution that ensures documents meet organizational standards, remain accurate, and are filled consistently. By using Large Language Models (LLMs) like GPT or BERT, the system validates documents and suggests autofill completions based on historical data. Human feedback is integrated to refine the AI’s performance, improving document quality over time.

## Problem Statement
Organizations handle large volumes of documents that must adhere to specific formatting, compliance, and accuracy standards. Manual document review is time-consuming and error-prone. The challenge is creating an AI system that analyzes and validates documents while integrating human feedback for continuous improvement.

---

## Project Outcome
By the end of the hackathon, participants will develop a prototype that combines AI document validation with human collaboration. The system will provide suggestions and allow users to validate and improve the AI’s outputs, making it adaptable to real-world applications.

---

## Key Objectives
- **Document Validation:** The AI will validate documents against organizational standards (e.g., formatting, compliance).
- **Autofill Suggestions:** The system will suggest completions for incomplete sections based on historical data.
- **Human-in-the-Loop (HITL):** Human feedback will improve AI performance over time.
- **Continuous Improvement:** The AI will learn and adapt from human corrections and historical data.

---

## Evaluation Criteria
- **Innovation:** How creative is the solution in blending AI and human feedback?
- **Functionality:** Does the application perform as intended?
- **User Experience:** Is the interface intuitive?
- **Impact:** How well does the solution solve the document validation problem?
- **HITL Integration:** How seamlessly does the human feedback process work?
